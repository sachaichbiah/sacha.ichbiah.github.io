I am a 2nd year Biophysics PhD student at College de France. I am part of Multiscale Physics of Morphogenesis team located in CIRB and supervised by Professor Herv√© Turlier. I recently undertook a research sabbatical at the BCAI collaborating with the University of Amsterdam. Currently, I am interning as a Research Scientist at Google DeepMind.

My is to give a 3D description of early embryonic development. I am combining physical modeling and deep learning algorithms to develop auto
developping deep le
learning invariant and equivariant representations. Simply put: whereas most of deep learning is concerned with finding the important information in an input, I focus on ignoring harmful or irrelevant parts of information. This is tantamount to leveraging symmetries and can be important to counteract biases or to better leverage structure in the data.

I am originally from . Before switching to Biophysics and Computer Vision for my PhD, I studied physics .
