title: About me
---

## I am a 2nd year Biophysics PhD student at College de France.
I am part of Multiscale Physics of Morphogenesis team located in CIRB and supervised by Professor Hervé Turlier. 

My goal is to give a 3D description of early embryonic development. Simply put, I am trying to infer forces shaping cellular clusters in 3D from microscopy images. Indeed, if modern microscopy recently enabled researchers to easily obtain enormous amounts of 3D videos stacks describing the development of early embryos, leveraging all this data and incorporate it into physical models remains challenging. I am combining physical and geometrical modeling and deep learning algorithms to develop new image processing algorithms. 

We are currently collaborating with several biologists around the world, and my goal would be to use these algorithms to shed light on the development of several organisms, as well as on organoids.

I grew up both in Frankfurt and Geneva. Before switching to Biophysics and Computer Vision for my PhD, I studied Quantum and Statistical Physics at École Polytechnique and at École Normale Supérieure (ENS Paris).
