title: About me
---

## I am a 2nd year Biophysics PhD student at College de France.
I am part of Multiscale Physics of Morphogenesis team located in CIRB and supervised by Professor Hervé Turlier. 

My goal is to give a 3D description of early embryonic development. Modern microscopy recently enabled researchers to easily obtain enormous amounts of 3D videos stacks describing the development of early embryos. However, leveraging all this data and incorporate it into physical models remains challenging. I am combining physical modeling and deep learning algorithms to develop new image processing algorithms. Besides, I am developping image analysis and geometry processing tools to infer forces shaping embryos.


I grew up both in Frankfurt and Geneva. Before switching to Biophysics and Computer Vision for my PhD, I studied Quantum and Statistical Physics at École Polytechnique and at École Normale Supérieure (ENS Paris).
