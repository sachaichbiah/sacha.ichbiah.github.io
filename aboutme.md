## I am a 2nd year Biophysics PhD student at College de France.
I am part of Multiscale Physics of Morphogenesis team located in CIRB and supervised by Professor Hervé Turlier. 

My goal is to give a 3D description of early embryonic development. I am combining physical modeling and deep learning algorithms to develop new image processing algorithms. 
developping deep le
learning invariant and equivariant representations. Simply put: whereas most of deep learning is concerned with finding the important information in an input, I focus on ignoring harmful or irrelevant parts of information.

I grew up both in Frankfurt and close to Geneva. Before switching to Biophysics and Computer Vision for my PhD, I studied Quantum and Statistical Physics at École Polytechnique and at École Normale Supérieure (ENS Paris).
